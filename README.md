# Project Crypto Primitives
 A collection of implementations of cryptographic primitives for educational purposes. 
 Notes:
 -> Security: These implementations are neither secure nor optimized, the sole reason for their existence being readable and easy to understand.
 -> Reliability: These algorithms may or may not have gone through intense testing via test vectors, thus their reliability is at best questionable.
 -> Liability: These implementations are almost copies of what is written in their specifications - the algorithms thmselves are designed by other researchers, the sources of which will be listed by "best try effort". The author is not responsible for misuse of these algorithms and/or damage (moral, physical, mental, financial) caused by **ANY** use of these algorithms.
 -> Sources: Mostly from the original authors/inventors, RFCs and wikipedia.
 -> Usage: Please provide a link to this repository if its contents are used on an academic or commercial scale!
