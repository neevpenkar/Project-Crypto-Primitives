This document is an extension of the parent document which resides mostly in the main branch.
This implementation was created with the halp of the following file: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/pdfrfc/rfc7693.txt.pdf

The implementor does not have anything to do with the architecture and design of this algorithm.
Most accurate resource to give credit I could find: https://www.blake2.net/blake2.pdf
For test vectors: https://github.com/emilbayes/blake2b/blob/master/test-vectors.json


Note
This folder in the repository contains a logging class (and a half accurate log file). This file is meant for logging the values in the working variables after every operation.
This is to ease debugging, in case a ready implementation is available. It can be used to log values after every step and then can be compared with correct implementations to find the operation which failed to work correctly.
